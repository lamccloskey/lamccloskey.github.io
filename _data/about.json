I created this website using Jekyll and the Bulma CSS framework. The theme is free to use if you're interested, just check out my GitHub page for the source. On this website I will write blog posts on tech topics and showcase some of my personal projects. Initially, at least, I won't keep a consitent pace on blog posts or portfolio updates. However, I will showcase topics I find interesting enough to write about or implement from time to time.",
